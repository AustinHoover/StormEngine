## High Level Overview
https://github.com/ppiastucki/recast4j
recast4j is a java lib that provides java version of recast and detour. Recast generates navmeshes, detour handles pathfinding through meshes generated with recast.
Goal is to eventually bake them into the engine.


## Future Goals

 - Overhaul existing, broken navmesh logic to leverage recast and detour
