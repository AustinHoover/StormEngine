@page biomegenerationproblems Biome Generation Problems

Different cases to consider when working on a biome generation system
 - Floating islands
 - "Bowls" where the perimeter of an area has one style, and the center has another
 - Blending between biomes
 - Mountains
 - Cliffs
 - Biomes with tall structures (ie trees generated with voxels, rock spires, plateaus, etc)
 - Superstructure biomes (World tree, massive mountains, etc)
 - Oceans
 - Lakes
 - Rivers
 - Large scale overhangs


Operations we might want to do
 - Placing things on the surface
 - Solve navgation at the macro scale
