techniques to consider:

adding different types of noise
gradients of different types of noise
fractal brownian noise
sines pulling from sines
noise functions pulling from sines
applying 2d values to the surface (top) of a 3d noise map
subtracting true 3d noise from a 2d heightmap to account for cave entrances


spatially partitioning 3d shapes using the same trick as the voronoi noise but in 3d
IE, have a torus defined in 3d that is bounded in cells
