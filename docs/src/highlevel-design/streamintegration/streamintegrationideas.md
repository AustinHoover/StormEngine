A neat stretch goal for the engine would be to support integration with youtube/twitch streams to allow streamers to do stuff with their viewers/chat.
An idea is if we have dungeons in separate realms that the player is going to while exploring, have a loading screen for 15-30 seconds (that is optionally skippable). During this loading screen allow the chat to vote for a combat challenge, puzzle, etc.
