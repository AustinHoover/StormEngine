If/when fluidsim is a part of the engine, have a creature that constantly keeps a bubble of water around itself (drawing from nearby sources as it approaches them). When it runs up to regular creatures to try to attack them, it will force them into swimming state or outright kill them.
Ocean-faring monsters that create voids that push away liquid (thus making them challenging to fight on a boat)

Scary creatures that, when entering a chunk, gradually reduce environment volume to zero (ie crickets stop chirping because it's so scary) Like a demon scarecrow or devil

Custom cursors per playable race (ie gauntlet for humans, claw for demons, etc)
