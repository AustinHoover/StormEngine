Procedural generation works better the more levers you have to tweak the generation with.
Ideas for levers with respect to layout of dungeon templates:
 - "Themes" of floors. IE having a spider themed floor, a magma/fire themed floor, etc
 - "Navigation Lines". Having specific templates that are used to make easily identifiable highways through the dungeon that guide the player between highest level points of interest
 - Color coordinating within floors
 - Puzzle subsections of floors
  - Working off of puzzles, have a central mechanism with explicit rooms around the mechanism (think a pillar that raises/lowers, a water level, etc)
  - Generate rooms connecting all of these explicit rooms
  - Don't necessarily want to connect them optimally. Players enjoy having to remember the location of other rooms earlier in the dungeon metroidvania style.
