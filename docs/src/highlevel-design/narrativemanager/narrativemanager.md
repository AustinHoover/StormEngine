TODO: describe

basic idea is have a system that watches over each player and tries to shape the world around them to create interesting stories.
ie creates quests and tries to lightly railroad the players on to them -- or at the very least provides them as options.
Will need to have plotline templates and generate/select characters to be members of that plotline.
Then move macro level pieces around to conform to the plotline.
