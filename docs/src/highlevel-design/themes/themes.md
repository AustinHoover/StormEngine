@page themes Themes

Keep track of an array of themes that are leveraged during generation to make results more cohesive.
IE, a theme might be "evil", used in generation to grab associated themes for villians.

In the villian example, "Fire" might be associated with evil and thusly fire motifs are used when deciding the armor to clad the villian in.
Another example might be "Warfare" being associated with evil and the villian thusly being generated with a warmonger past.
A third example might be "Anger" being associated with evil and the villian being generated with a personality matrix that is prone to anger.



Another way I would like to leverage this is in narrative design. While there is the generic motiff array, I want to have larger themes that plotlines can generate around.
Have a list of premade "topics" that can bend narrative templates to support them.
IE, a topic might be 'when is violence just'. This is used in a conspiracy template to construct specific examples where players have to make decisions that force them to confront this topic.
