### Volcano
 - 

### Mega Crystals
 - Massive crystals of some type that are solid through

### World Tree
 - Generated out of marching cubes terrain (leaf type, bark type, wood type)
 - Make it large enough to generate rooms inside the tree and, for example, stairs leading all the way up the tree
 - Will need to place objects, communities, or something inside the tree. People are going to be very disappointed if there's nothing inside the tree. Also need to write logic for characters roaming around the top of the tree. Could maybe make it flying-creature-only types just in case.

### Storm Columns
 - Marching cubes "solid cloud" surrounded by swirling particles
 - Place civilizations, bosses, dungeons, etc up there
 - Columns of cloud currents lifting or lowering from the roof/floor of the inside of the cloud
 - Plasma currents/channels of energy/lightning

### Ocean Voids
 - A giant, hollow column of stone that leads just to the surface of the ocean. Water slowly trickles over the side
 - Put late game bosses inside the column

### Niagara Communities
 - Massive waterfalls with outcrops sticking out between them that have points of interest on them

### Pillars to Gods
 - Massive pillars of some type of material that serve as dungeons

### Split Mountains
 - A mountain split into two or more parts down the center
 - Loot at the base, or a big boss or something

### Massive Opaque Magic Spheres
 - Inside is a radically different biome (like something extremely magical, or evil, or good, or something)
 - IDK if this should be made out of marching cubes or particles or what

### Massive Ruins
 - For instance sticking out of the side of a mountain and of comparable size to said mountain

### Sunset Ruins
 - Extremely tall ruins that are permanently sunset. Always overcast with godrays shooting through.
