## Behavior Trees


## Synchronized Fields

## Supported Types
The types that are supported

### Enums
How to work with enums

### Frequencies
ie can we toggle how often it updates, or debounce it


## Usage Notes

### Assumptions
 - The first line of all parsed files is the package declaration for the package that this file is inside of (ie the behavior tree electrosphere.whatever.myTree has "package electrosphere.whatever" at the top)
 This is so that imports generation in the helper functions file can be performed accurately
